There are plentiful ingredients in Respighiâ€™s Piano Concerto. Rhapsodic flourishes, triumphal declamations, huge, dense chords and passages of lyrical contemplation. Written in 1902, when he was in his early twenties, it shows multiple influences, none more than that of the Russia where he was working at this time as principal viola in the Russian Imperial Orchestra. But whilst the concerto successfully embraces the grandiose gestures of Russian orchestral music, it offers neither the originality nor the emotional depth that makes contemporary concertos (by Rachmaninov, for instance) so popular today. It lasts only 24 minutes, but its incoherent, rambling structure makes it seem a great deal longer.
